# Shamir-s-Secrets-Share
I have tried to create Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm using Python. Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic algorithm for splitting a secret into multiple shares, such that any subset of the shares can be combined to reconstruct the original secret, but no subset smaller than the required threshold can do so.
